            Google Glass is a type of wearable technology with an optical head-mounted display (OHMD).
            It was developed by Google with the mission of producing a mass-market ubiquitous computer.
            Google Glass displays information in a smartphone-like hands-free format.
            Wearers communicate with the Internet via natural language voice commands.
            Google started selling a prototype of Google Glass to qualified "Glass Explorers" in the US on April 15, 2013,
            for a limited period for $1,500, before it became available to the public on May 15, 2014, for the same price.
